# Web-RPG-Helper
Simple D&amp;D 2e character creator and Traveller planet creation website
This was created in my senior year in high school, when I had absolutely no knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or JQuery. I'm currently updating these old files now that I know a bit more. 

# To Do

- [ ] Conform to normal coding standards (comments, variable names)

- [ ] Make code more efficient (functions)

- [ ] Update CSS for a professional and inviting design

- [ ] Add item buying at the end of D&D character creation.
