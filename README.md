Simple D&amp;D 2e character creator and Traveller planet creation website
This was created in my senior year in high school, when I had absolutely no knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or JQuery. I'm currently updating these old files now that I know a bit more. 
Once the old versions are updated to fit normal coding standards, the next priority is to update the design.
After the code makes sense and the pages look presentable, then character creation from other RPGs can be added.
